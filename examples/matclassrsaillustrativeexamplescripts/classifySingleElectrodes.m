% -----------------------------
% Illustrative example for MatClassRSA toolbox. 
%
% This script loads a Matlab data file that has been downloaded from a 
% public EEG repository (https://purl.stanford.edu/bq914sc3730) and 
% performs category-level (6-class) classifications on the data from one
% electrode at a time. The resulting collection of classifier accuracies
% are then plotted on a scalp map.
%
% This script requires the electrodes location file 
% "Hydrocel GSN 128 1.0.sfp", the custom helper function getLocs124, and 
% the readlocs and topoplot functions from the EEGLAB toolbox. All of 
% these necessary files are provided with the MatClassRSA toolbox.
