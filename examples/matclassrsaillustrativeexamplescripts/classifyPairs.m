% -----------------------
% Illustrative example for MatClassRSA toolbox. 
%
% This script loads a Matlab data file that has been downloaded from a 
% public EEG repository (https://purl.stanford.edu/bq914sc3730) and 
% performs all possible pairwise classifications of the stimulus categories
% in the 3D EEG data frame. 
%
% We use the customizable functionalities of the computeRDM function to 
% transform the collection of pairwise accuracies to an RDM. The RDM is 
% then visualized as a matrix image, in an MDS plot, as a dendrogram, and 
% as a minimum spanning tree.

%%%% Costruct the RDM using optional name-value pairs.
% We set 'normalize' to 'none' because values on the diagonal are already
% zero (self-distance is zero). We can symmetrize with 'average' because we
% don't care about the actual distance values (accuracies) but will rather
% convert to ranks later. We don't need to convert to distances because
% unlike confusions, accuracies already serve as distance measures.
% Finally, we convert to rank distances.
