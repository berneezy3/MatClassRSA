# MatClassRSA
Classification toolbox in Matlab for EEG data.  

This dir contains original Matlab functions from the EEGLAB (formerly ICA/EEG)
Matlab toolbox, all released under the Gnu public license (see eeglablicence.txt). 
See the EEGLAB tutorial and reference paper (URLs given below) for more information.

Sub-directories:

/src - Location of all MatClassRSA functions and helper functions
/examples  - Locations of examples and illustrative analyses

Dependencies:

The software is compatible with Matlab 2016b and above.  Some functions may be usable on earlier versions of MATLAB, 
but it has not been fully tested on previous versions.  
The software requires two Matlab toolboxes:  the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and the Image Processing Toolbox.

To use EEGLAB: 

Download the latest version of this package at https://github.com/berneezy3/MatClassRSA/

Upon startup of Matlab, run the following in the Matlab IDE to add the MatClassRSA functions into your search path:

> downloadPath = <Your download directory here, in char array format>;
> addpath([downloadPath 'src/Classification/libsvm-3.21/matlab']);
> addpath([downloadPath 'src/Classification/']);
> addpath([downloadPath 'src/RDM_Computation/');
> addpath([downloadPath 'src/Visualization']);

MatClassRSA functions will be runnable from this point.  To automatically import MatClassRSA upon Matlab startup, 
please create a ‘startup.m’ somewhere in your Matlab search path (this can be found using the command “path”), 
and add the above lines into it.
