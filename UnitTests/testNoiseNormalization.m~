% I'm not completely sure how to check that this is working correctly
%
% TODO: Add a bit more info in the docstring as to which implementation
% described in Guggenmos is used (is it MNN (not UNN) with the epoch
% method?)
%
% TODO: I get an error at line 52 if a 2D matrix is input. Does it even
% make sense to attempt noise normalization when we have only 1 channel of
% data, where there is no "error covariance between different sensors" to
% be considered? I wonder if the function should state outright that it
% only works on multi-channel data that are input with the specified 3D
% shape...
