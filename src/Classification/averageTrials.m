% 
% Function to average trials for training data matrix X and corresponding
% label vector Y
% Input Args:
%       X - training data matrix
%       Y - label vector
%       groupSize - number of trials you wish each group to average
%       handleRemainder (optional) - method to handle remainder trials.  
%           For example if you have 21 rows with label 1, and set averaging 
%           group size to 5, you would have 4 groups (20/5), and 1 remainder 
%           row with label 1.
%           --- options ---
%               'discard'
%                   disregard the remaining data.
%               'newGroup'
%                   Creates a new averaged row with the remainder trials,
%                   despite the rows not fulfilling the group size.
%               'append'
%                   Appends the remaining data to the last averaged row of
%                   the same label.
%               'distribute'
%                   Distributes the remaining data to the different groups
%                   of the same label.
%
% Output Args:
%       averagedX - the X matrix after averaging
%       averagedY - the label vector for the trials in averagedXh
%       
% Example:
