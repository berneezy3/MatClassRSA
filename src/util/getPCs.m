%-------------------------------------------------------------------
% Function to extract principal componenets via singular value
% decomposition
%
% INPUT ARGS:
%       X - training data matrix
%       PCs - if value is a positive integer, either number of PCs to extract based on significance , or variance explained by PCs if value
%       between 0 and 1
%
% OUTPUT ARGS:
%       y - training data matrix with only principal compenents
%
% EXAMPLES:

% TODO:
%   Retrieve the indices of the principal componenets
