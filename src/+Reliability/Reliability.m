classdef Reliability
% This class contains the functions to compute EEG data reliability.  
%
% To compute reliability, you must first create a instance of the 
% MatClassRSA object, then access the  "Reliability" member variable  
% to call the function of interest.  Functions of this class may also 
% require EEG data and labels to be passed into.  Below is an example call
% to computeSampleSizeReliability():
%
% RSA = MatClassRSA;
% C = RSA.Reliability.computeSampleSizeReliability(X, Y);
%
% Below are the list of classification functions contained in this class:
%   - computeSampleSizeReliability()
%   - computeSpaceTimeReliability()
